# Always start with the latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 2. **Creating Your Work Branch**

# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Examples:
# git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode

# or
git commit -m "Fix: Login validation error"
# or
git commit -m "Update: Dashboard chart styling"
```

### 5. **Pushing to GitHub**
```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. **Creating Pull Request**

2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch
4. Add description of your changes
5. Request review from team members
6. Click "Create Pull Request"

### 7. **Code Review Process**
- Team members review your code
- They can suggest changes
- You can make updates and push again
- Once approved, the PR gets merged

### 8. **Getting Updates from Others**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes (including merged PRs)
git pull origin main

# Now you have everyone's changes!
```

## 🔄 How Changes Flow Through the Team

### **Scenario: Teammate A adds a new feature**

1. **Teammate A**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/add-expense-categories
   # ... makes changes ...
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Expense categories feature"
   git push origin feature/add-expense-categories
   # Creates Pull Request
   ```

2. **Teammate B (Reviewer)**:
   - Reviews the code on GitHub
   - Tests the changes locally
   - Approves the Pull Request

3. **Teammate A**:
   - Merges the Pull Request into main

4. **Everyone (Teammate B, C, D, etc.)**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   # Now everyone has the new expense categories feature!
   ```

## 📁 Real Examples

### **Example 1: Adding a New Page**
```bash
# Teammate wants to add a "Reports" page
git checkout -b feature/add-reports-page

# Creates: src/pages/Reports.tsx
# Updates: src/App.tsx (adds route)
# Updates: src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx (adds menu item)

git add .
git commit -m "Add: Reports page with charts and analytics"
git push origin feature/add-reports-page
# Create Pull Request
```

### **Example 2: Fixing a Bug**
```bash
# Teammate fixes a bug in the budget calculation
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-budget-calculation

# Fixes: src/pages/Budget.tsx
# Updates: src/components/dashboard/MetricCard.tsx

git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Budget calculation error in progress bar"
git push origin bugfix/fix-budget-calculation
# Create Pull Request
```

### **Example 3: Styling Updates**
```bash
# Teammate improves the UI styling
git checkout -b update/improve-dashboard-styling

# Updates: src/index.css
# Updates: src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
# Updates: tailwind.config.ts

git add .
git commit -m "Update: Improve dashboard styling and responsiveness"
git push origin update/improve-dashboard-styling
# Create Pull Request
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **Before Starting Work**
```bash
# Always get the latest code first
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### **Naming Branches**
- `feature/add-something` - New features
- `bugfix/fix-something` - Bug fixes
- `update/change-something` - Updates to existing features
- `refactor/improve-something` - Code improvements

### **Commit Messages**
```
type: Brief description

- Detailed description if needed
- List of specific changes
```

Types: `Add:`, `Fix:`, `Update:`, `Remove:`, `Refactor:`, `Style:`, `Docs:`

### **Testing Before Committing**
```bash
# Always test your changes
npm run dev          # Test in browser
npm run build        # Ensure it builds
npm run lint         # Check code quality
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "Your branch is behind"**
```bash
# Solution: Get latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
```

### **Issue: Merge conflicts**
```bash
# Solution: Resolve conflicts manually
git status                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### **Issue: Can't push changes**
```bash
# Solution: Pull first, then push
git pull origin your-branch-name
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## 📊 Team Coordination

### **Daily Workflow**
1. **Morning**: Pull latest changes
2. **Work**: Make changes on feature branch
3. **Evening**: Push changes and create PR

### **Weekly Workflow**
1. **Monday**: Plan features for the week
2. **Tuesday-Thursday**: Work on features
3. **Friday**: Review and merge PRs

### **Communication**
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and features
